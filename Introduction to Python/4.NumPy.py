# NumPy Side Effects
# numpy is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

# First of all, numpy arrays cannot contain elements with different types. Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as +, -, * and / have a different meaning for regular Python lists and numpy arrays.

np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball

# Print out the type of np_baseball

# Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays
# If your 2D numpy array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements "a" and "c" are extracted from a list of lists.

# # numpy
# import numpy as np
# np_x = np.array(x)
# np_x[:, 0]
# The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The : is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.
import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:, 1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123, 0])


import numpy as np

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball

# Print out the mean of np_height_in
